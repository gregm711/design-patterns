## SOLID Principles

### SRP - single line of responsibility
Classes should do one thing, avoid god objects

For example, break out saving/loading to different class than the objects being accessed.


OCP + specification


open for extension, closed for modification

Liskov substitution principal
Should be able to subsitutue a subclass for base class



ISP -interface segregation principle


DIP - dependency inversion principle
- high level modules should not depend on low level modules
- Both should depend on abstractions

- Abstractions should not depend on details
- Details should depend on abstractions
